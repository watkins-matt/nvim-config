# Nvim-Config

This is my personal Neovim configuration.

## Termux Support

My goal was to make the configuration work on both normal
systems and with Termux. A termux-bootstrap.sh script is
provided which should install all dependencies.

## Installation on Termux

```bash
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/watkins-matt/nvim-config/main/termux-bootstrap.sh > termux-bootstrap.sh
bash termux-bootstrap.sh
```
